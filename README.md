# Logistic-Regression

Logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a 
target variable. The nature of target or dependent variable is dichotomous, which means there would be only 
two possible classes.


This project will be a walkthrough of a simple Logistic Regression model in an attempt to strategize a basic ad-targeting campaign for a social media network/website.
We'd like to implement an appropriate model so that we know who our target audience is for this specific advertisement, thus maximizing our click-through rate. 
We'd like to show younger users this ad with a lower probability than we show it to our older/wealthier users, and use that time/space to expose the younger users to ads that they are more likely to be interested in.

Here Our dataset contains some information about all of our users in the social network, including their User ID, Gender, Age, and Estimated Salary. 
The last column of the dataset is a vector of booleans describing whether or not each individual ended up clicking on the advertisement (0 = False, 1 = True)
